# [About]($section.id('about'))

I have a little bit of a hoarding problem when it comes to browser tabs and bookmarks...

It's not uncommon that the browser on my phone has 200+ tabs open,
and my browser bookmarks are currently somewhere around 1000
(don't ask about my saved posts on Reddit).

Every once in a while, I go through them one-by-one, deleting the ones that I absolutely don't need,
and copying the ones I still wan't into a document that will innevitably just sit there just like before,
but in a different place this time.

And yea, I almost never look through them when they're on my phone,
and I certainly don't after they've migrated off of it.
I know its crazy, but I don't think that means I shouldn't keep them around.

Basically, I have problems with my attention and memory,
and I've learned to compensate for that by using open browser tabs as an extension of my memory.
Ive learned that I cant trust myself to remember to take notes on the things I research,
so leaving product pages, papers and articles open is the next best thing.

The thing is, all these open tabs arent just thoughts and rabbit-holes that I want to remember,
they're projects that I haven't finished-- literally, and metaphorically.

There's tabs for the literal projects,
like sewing patterns for an accessory that I haven't gotten around to making.
Theres also the research kind of project where I'm trying to reach some sort of personal understanding,
and if I havent gotten there yet,
I'll leave the tabs open that represent the furthest I've gotten towards that understanding.

Projects can live pretty much indefinitely if you don't go out of your way to define an ending point for them.

Sometimes projects die on their own, and you just need to internalize it.

> If buying one is more worth it to you, the project is dead.

Sometimes you think a project isn't done, when is actually is, but you're not quite satisfied with it.

Sometimes projects are very close to being done, even if its just an [MVP]($link.url('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product').new(true)),
and you just need to go out of your way to get them there. They arent gonna finish themselves.

So that's basically what I want to do here.
I'm going to go through my thousands of browser tabs, bookmarks, saved posts,
and I'm going to finish my projects.
